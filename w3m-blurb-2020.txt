Celebrating Boalsburg, the “Birthplace of Memorial Day”

The Nittany Amateur Radio Club (NARC; https://nittany-arc.net) will operate a special event station with the callsign W3M from Friday, May 22 to Monday, May 25, 2020. The station will celebrate Boalsburg Pennsylvania’s special place in American history.

NARC members and other interested hams will operate from their home stations using the W3M callsign on the 80, 40, 20, and 15 meter bands, using phone, digital, and CW. We will also take check-ins on the W3YA and W3GA repeaters and on Allstar node 51401.

A commemorative QSO card will be sent to all hams who contact W3M and send a self-addressed stamped envelope to: W3M c/o Nittany Amateur Radio Club, P.O. Box 614, State College, PA 16801.
